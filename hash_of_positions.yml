    concluding with "advanced interactive projects", for classes of up to 19 people.


    "Projects in HTML" begins with a thorough breakdown of the semantics of information,
    content hierarchy, the way that the meaning of content influences the visual layout,
    and vice versa. I have taught this intro class 7 times over the past 4 years,
    culminating in the student''s midterm, showing off their understanding of 3rd-party
    html structural analysis, design planning and implementation, as well as their
    final, the creation of a custom theme for a blogging platform from design, development,
    plugin skinning and deployment.


    Interactive Design Concepts builds upon the foundation of its "Projects in HTML"
    requirement and focuses on using the internet as a medium for art. The concepts
    of API exploration, public code library usage, data filtering and the aesthetic
    of the meme are all covered in a pragmatic, results-focused approach designed
    to ease into the world of data mining.'

    partners have historically achieved significant improvements in cash collections
    measured against the contractual amount due for healthcare services, which we
    refer to as net revenue yield. \n\nPhysician Advisory Services: \nAccretive PAS™

    of identifying a solution to help slow down the outsourcing of jobs in America,
    perhaps even lowering the unemployment rate along the way. Relociti's focus is
    multi-fold. First to identify candidates based on where they are open to relocating
    (Their DREAM CITY), and making this transition to new employment and a new city,
    an exciting, rewarding, more gentle, and swift experience. \n\nSimultaneously
    we bring a new breed of candidates and relief to employers who are suffering from
    the consequences of not finding the right talent in a timely fashion, if at all.
    The Tech Talent Shortage has created a situation where the amount of time and
    resources that it takes to fill a position, can be quite overwhelmingly costly
    to a firm on multiple levels. By identifying candidates who employers would never
    have discovered, we will help shorten that gap and create a level playing field
    across our country; creating a newly identifiable division of candidates.\n\nWhether

    competitive edge in their hiring, or a dynamite tech recruiter who is seeking
    a unique & exciting opportunity, we invite you to join us to help make America

  :summary: ! "The Kenandy vision: manufacturing management built for the cloud\n
    \nManufacturing is changing. Dramatically. As vertically integrated manufacturing
    disappears, replaced by today's horizontal networks of global suppliers and distributors,
    manufacturing companies require lean, agile, collaborative operations to maintain
    market value and efficiently deliver innovative products. Traditional ERP systems
    just haven't evolved with the challenge—lacking a social platform, mobility, and
    openness, they are neither lean nor agile, and tend to impede rather than foster
    collaboration and innovation. \n\nKenandy envisioned a better way. And we've delivered
    it—a new kind of application in the cloud. Designed specifically for the realities
    of today's distributed manufacturing operations and global supply chain networks.
    \n\nBuilt 100% natively on the highly evolved Force.com, salesforce.com's enterprise
    cloud computing platform, Kenandy leverages the platform's amazingly flexible
    social, mobile, and open features, bringing a use-just-what-you-need approach
    together with social media capabilities to meet today's challenges of inventory
    management, engineering, purchasing, production, and resource planning for better
    manufacturing management. \n\nWith no software or hardware to own, no horrific
    future upgrades, the secure, on-demand Kenandy application enables manufacturers
    to be everything they want to be: lean, agile, collaborative, and innovative.
    \n\nWelcome to our world—the new collaborative world of manufacturing in the cloud."

    and daughter have been in the restaurant business for over 30 years, bringing
    San Jose a taste of Vietnam. With Saba Café we moved a bit north and a bit more
    contemporary with a slick, clean interior and a wine and sake list to please any
    palette.'

  :summary: ! 'Proper Cursive is an interdisciplinary studio — combining a love of
    design, technology, art, photography, and visual communication — to create contemporary
    interactive solutions and exciting design.


    User-Centered Design


    Interface design should enhance the experience of the user without drawing unnecessary
    attention to itself. My first priority is to make the user''s experience as simple
    and enjoyable as possible. The design process should balance technical functionality
    and visual elements to create a system that is intuitive, usable, and adaptable
    to changing user needs.


    Web Development


    Like any finely tuned engineering project, a website depends on performance, scalability,
    reliability and interoperability. Without a proper engine the beautifully restored
    classic is merely a show piece, not a real sports car. In the end, it is impossible
    to separate the design of a website from the technology that makes it work.



    Mobile First


    It is likely that within the next few years, more users will connect to the Internet
    using mobile devices than desktop computers. This will have a profound impact
    on how websites are planned, designed, and built.'

    grind, I want to not only go "outside" the proverbial box, I want to leave it
    behind. I am pursuing online experimentation in creating what I call new community
    paradigms which will involve gathering online resources and groups advocating
    for community issues into a wiki as well as writing about the development of those
    ideas and resources in a blog. I will be open for opportunities for collaboration
    on ideas or projects if someone believes I can be a resource.  In this time of
    turmoil brought on by recent dramatic events in the California economic development
    profession, I do not want to accept or lend support to continuation of same old
    game that got us into this mess in the first place.

  :summary: ! "Be Visible Associates is a specialty firm uniquely providing a full
    range of Internet-marketing services to businesses. Most businesses today have
    a website, but very few are actively using it to grow. We help them by teaching
    them how to use the Internet, Social Media, email, and their website to be in
    the right place at the right time to be in front of people who have decided that
    they need a service, but haven’t decided who they are going to buy it from. \nBusiness
    websites often need a wide range of help that goes beyond Google ads and search
    engine optimization. Be Visible is effective at “tuning up” websites to ensure
    that each hard-won visitor to the site quickly sees the value that the company
    has to offer. \nIf you or a business that you know needs help harnessing the power
    of the Internet for their business, please give Be Visible a call."

  :summary: ! 'ZenMetrics is a tool to analyze your competitor and your Facebook Page
    content allowing you to discover best content for your page. Founder of ZenMetrics
    Ryoma who lives in Tokyo has managed several Facebook Pages for his client and
    his company and it was always challenge for him to find best performing content.


    He could use tool like Facebook Insight to analyze his own page content but it
    was not very user-friendly and was not allowing him to analyze his competitor
    content. He had to download CSV file from Facebook Insight and modify it on Excel
    spreadsheet to manage his content and discover best performing content which was
    very time consuming.


    He tried many existing tools to solve his pain point but none of them worked well.
    So he decided to create his own tool in Lean Startup methodology which was recommended
    many successful entrepreneurs for him.


    At first he has talked many potential early adopters to validate his ideas using
    email template and interview scripts from Running Lean by Ash Maurya which is
    great guide book for practicing Lean Startup for SaaS businesses. Once he collected
    enough data to validate his idea, he started seeking for developer who can be
    potential co-founder of ZenMetrics.


    He met really talented Japanese developer, Reo Mori. Once he found shared vision
    in technology and changing the world, he really tried hard to approach Reo to
    join the team. To make it happen, he followed advice from successful entrepreneurs
    Joel Gascoigne and Leo Widrich from Buffer. He showed Reo the data collected through
    customer development and business model with his passion.


    Finally Reo agreed to help me as co-founder and started building MVP. We now have
    another skilled developer Suin on board who is friend of Reo and the person who
    introduced Reo to me initially. Now we are really working hard to solve the problem
    “Finding effective content for Facebook Page is hard work”.'

    His knowledge of social media and his level of engagement with the audience helped
    keep the sessions dynamic and interesting"


    Richard MacDonald - Glasgow Young Professionals - Twitter Workshop - Fed 2012


    "Mike''s delivery was well-paced and enthusiastic, evidently he commands an extremely
    strong understanding of the subject matter. As well as the practical examples
    he used, he also mixed up the format well by including video content amusing examples
    of how things can go wrong from a PR perspective. He also confidently answered
    some complex questions from our members at the end. I''d happily recommend Mike,
    regardless of the audience type"

    -  June 3, 2011


    “I had the pleasure of working with Mike on the Institute of Fundraising''s #DigiFun2011
    Conference. Mike''s presentation ''Making the most of your blog'' was very well
    received by delegates. Knowledgeable, engaging and inclusive - I''d readily suggest
    Mike as a speaker for other digital events”


    Sarah Devlin, Business Development Manager, 55 Degrees Ltd


    “Having recently attended the B2B Scotland 2011 at the SECC, which was an event
    geared to providing a networking and educational platform for Scotland’s business
    community I was fortunate enough to attend a Workshop led by Mike. Mike provided
    a large group of delegates with a powerpoint led talk which captured my attention
    immediately. The clear, direct, relaxed approach which he took allowed me to easily
    follow a topic which was relatively new to me. He immediately built trust and
    credibility through his ability to communicate the complexities of Social Media
    in a simplistic manner allowing delegates to evaluate the most suitable strategy
    for their business with increased confidence"'

  :summary: ! 'President from 2007-2011, Board member and Executive Director prior.


    The League of Composers, created in 1923, is the nation’s oldest organization
    devoted to contemporary music. The League draws on a remarkably rich history,
    including such groundbreaking premieres as Schönberg’s Die Glückliche Hand, Béla
    Bartók’s Village Scenes, Samuel Barber’s Piano Sonata and Anton Webern’s Symphony
    for Chamber Orchestra. The League also sponsored the American premiere of Igor
    Stravinsky’s ballet, Le Sacre du Printemps, many pieces by Aaron Copland, György
    Ligeti’s Horn Trio, Karlheinz Stockhausen’s Harlequin, and many works by current
    honorary Board Co-Chairs Elliott Carter and Milton Babbitt.


    In 1954, the League of Composers became the US chapter of the International Society
    of Contemporary Music (ISCM) and has since been known as the League of Composers/ISCM.


    In 2008, the League returned to its roots in an effort to recapture the excitement
    and prestige it enjoyed in its heyday, refining its mission, launching new initiatives,
    and creating a new orchestral ensemble. Although New York City offers an unparalleled
    array of chamber music concerts throughout the year, there remains a limited number
    of opportunities to experience new music through the richness of the orchestra.
    The orchestral works of established living composers are rarely performed, and
    the works of emerging composers are performed even less. To fill this void, we
    created the Orchestra of the League of Composers by expanding the Chamber Players
    of the League/ISCM. In conjunction with the development of the orchestra and the
    new initiatives, the new administration made it a priority to widen the  musical
    aesthetic of concert programming to better reflect the scope of today’s range
    of styles in new music and attract a new generation of listeners, much as the
    organization did in its early years. The 2008-09 season reflected all of these
    changes and culminated in the debut of the orchestra on our season finale.'

    helping clients find the best investments.  Whether you’re seeking a home, selling
    or buying an investment property downtown Manhattan where Vidal works you’ll be
    in good hands with the quality experience, dedication and knowledge Vidal brings
    to every deal.\n\nVidal’s great focus and discipline were honed in the military,
    where he served in the USMC Reserves and was activated for the Persian Gulf War.
    \ These strong values carried over into his detail-oriented careers in international
    private banking, mortgage banking and real estate, and in the expert service he
    has continually provided his clients.  \n\n“I treat each individual’s real estate
    purchase just as if were my own, with utmost care and responsibility,” says Vidal,
    whose keen market insight inspired the sound purchase of his own condo just before
    the recession of 2001 – a move that launched his real estate career.  Vidal enjoys
    sharing this same insight with first-time homebuyers, those who are relocating,
    or anyone looking to buy property in New York City.  His expertise is enhanced
    through his success in the worlds of private banking, then mortgage banking gained
    during his real estate career, which armed Vidal well to help qualify buyers,
    and guide them properly in the right home purchase and mortgage choice.\n\nFormerly
    an International Private Banker for Chase Manhattan Bank and Bank Julius Baer,
    one of the largest private Swiss Banks based in Zurich, Vidal, a Series 7 license
    holder with the SEC, is intimately familiar with consulting high-net-worth clients.
    A graduate of the University of California at Berkeley with a double major in
    History and Political Economies in Industrialized Societies, Vidal is multilingual
    in English, Spanish, Portuguese and French.  He resides and owns his apartment
    in the West Village, and enjoys all forms of exercise as well as bike riding to
    raise funds for charity in spare time."

    Sessions in Somerville, MA. Coordinating schedules with local and touring bands
    and other house venues, I was eventually booking two or three shows a month. Using

    Within the first year, I got my first paid job to produce a live concert DVD.
    Since then, my videos have been featured on NBC, NPR.org, PASTE.com, and Pitchfork.com.
    In 2011 I documented three bands on an international tour, and worked on a New
    England Emmy Award-winning short documentary about Africa Yoga Project, a nonprofit
    that teaches yoga in the slums, orphanages, and prisons of Kenya. While working
    closely with the creative director of Anthem Multimedia (and photo journalist

    include: a first-author paper published in Biomaterials that describes the development
    of biodegradable polymers for breast cancer drug delivery in 2D cell culture and
    3D organotypic models using mouse mammary epithelial cells; a first-author publication
    in Small describes the development of a new assay to quantify the number of plasmids
    associated with gene delivery nanoparticles and evaluates codelivery of multiple
    plasmids. This information provides critical insight that is beneficial for the
    field of nanomedicine; a PNAS paper describes work on HIF-1alpha gene therapy
    combined with transplantation of bone marrow-derived angiogenic cells for ischemic
    limb treatment in mice. Her current work focuses on developing non-viral strategies
    for feeder-independent reprogramming of normal human and patient-specific fibroblasts

    non-virally derived hiPSCs are differentiated towards neural cell lineage, specifically

    make a critical contribution by revealing the subjects of history that lack voice.

    unessential to picture a world with no pictures.

    Media Studies MA students, who are a part of an all-faculty inclusive art collective,
    BriCollab, we are hosting two events under the umbrella of Art and Event. Bricollab
    is a DIY art initiative encouraging all New School students to experience their
    classmates’ work, curate themed conventional and/or alternative exhibitions, produce
    new works collaboratively, and organize theoretical and practical workshops in
    an exchange system.\n\nWhile experimenting with creative practices, Bricollab
    members also seek opportunities to connect with professionals in the art world.\n\nAs
    part of our collective learning process, we are coordinating an Art and Event
    series and inviting some of the most clever and inspiring arts organizers in New
    York City. We intend to include a variety of perspectives focused on facilitating
    collaborative creative endeavors throughout the city with two sessions: inviting
    founding members of Trade School, and BAMarts Curator, David Harper.\n\nTrade
    School is an alternative learning space that runs on barter. Anyone can teach
    a class, and students can sign up for classes by agreeing to bring barter items
    that the teacher requests.\n\nBricollab members engaged in an interview-style
    dialogue with the Trade School team members questions concerning barter economy,
    art entrepreneurship, collaborative participation, the nature of their projects,
    and the needs/resources their organization fills in the New York City artscape.
    \n\nFrom the Brooklyn Academy of Music, BriCollab invited curator David Harper.
    His most recent exhibition Bcc#7 was a live collaboration at STADIUM Gallery between
    six NYC artists with six European artists that took place on March 9, 2012. Harper
    shared insights regarding his experience as a curator of telematic works.\n\nArt
